    <p data-aos="fade-up">Alisha describes her son, Tiago, who’s visually impaired and on the autism spectrum, as a funny, high-energy kid who loves to jump in muddy puddles.</p> 

    <p data-aos="fade-up">“He’s just so full of life, every day,” she says of her 3-year-old.</p> 
    
    <p data-aos="fade-up">A big part of the reason for that is Perkins’ Infant-Toddler Program, which has been working with him through home visits since he was just nine months old. Alisha says over the first two-and-a-half years of his life, she’s learned from Perkins how to understand Tiago’s strengths and unique needs, which has helped her empower him to be his happy-go-lucky self.</p> 
    
    <p data-aos="fade-up">When coronavirus shut down in-person services, though, the biggest help became the online network of families they found through the program. There, Alisha says she’s been able to connect with families like hers, while filling “a huge binder” with resources and answers to her most pressing questions.</p>
    
    <p data-aos="fade-up">“The parent group is just priceless. The information, support and friendship we’ve been receiving, there’s no end to it,” says Alisha. “These people have become our family.”</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-right">Early intervention is critical for young babies and toddlers like Tiago, in order to set them up for future success.</p> 

        <p data-aos="fade-right">Thanks to your support, that work has continued. In addition to connecting families like Tiago’s with one another through our online community, our teachers have delivered more than 1,000 hours of instruction for children with visual impairments ages birth to 3 throughout New England, all online.</p> 

        <p data-aos="fade-right">In fact, even before the pandemic, Perkins had begun offering online services to families in need. We will keep supporting families of young children remotely, as well as in person, even after we return to in-person learning. This pandemic has shown us just how much good can be done virtually.</p>
