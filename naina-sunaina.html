              <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
              <p>As we have always done, we continue to partner with families and supporters of Perkins to make sure no child is left unserved, no matter where they live. Today, those partnerships just look a little different. Thanks to support from donors, and unmatched determination from the families, schools and government bodies with whom we work, we are still empowering children all around the world.</p>

  <p data-aos="fade-up">Naina and Sunaina are twin girls from a village near Lucknow, India, who have visual impairments and additional disabilities. They spent most of the first eight years of their lives confined at home without any sort of educational or rehabilitative support. Their parents wanted to help them — they just didn’t know how.</p> 

  <p data-aos="fade-up">Then field workers from Jayati Bharatam, a partner of Perkins India, arrived.</p>

  <p data-aos="fade-up">Having found the sisters through a village-wide screening, the team helped identify their disabilities and then designed an intervention plan to put both girls on a new path. Most importantly, both sisters are now enrolled in school, and Naina, who has severe mobility issues, was also provided a wheelchair. This has changed not only the trajectory of both girls’ lives, but the whole family’s outlook about their capabilities.</p>

  <p data-aos="fade-up">“We didn’t have any information before, and since there was nothing available, we thought, what can be done except keep them at home?” says their father, Suresh. “Now that we know these people from Perkins, we feel encouraged. I’m confident now my girls will overcome their challenges.”</p>

      <h1 data-aos="fade-right">HOW WE’RE MOVING FORWARD</h1>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">Our future in India uplifting children like Naina and Sunaina lies with our local partners and families. </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">Through what we’re calling Project IDI, short for Identification and Intervention, we’re working with eye hospitals, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and schools to change children's lives. We’re identifying children in even the most remote villages and connecting them to the services they need to access education. Where those services don’t exist, we help to establish them. After they are established, we put them in the hands of our strong partners, who know their communities better than anyone, bringing about the best results.</p> 

      <p data-aos="fade-right">Today, we’re doing this work wearing masks, socially distanced, and through technology where applicable. As we continue that work, in however way we must, we’re replicating our Identification and Intervention model in other communities.</p> 

      <p data-aos="fade-right">As we look to grow our impact in the world’s second-most populous country, your support makes all the difference.</p>
