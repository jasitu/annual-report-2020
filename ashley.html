              <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
              <p>Our community is diverse in age, ability and location. Every member relies on us for different services and forms of support. This is something we’ve always celebrated. In the last year, given the sheer breadth of our work, the pandemic presented us with new challenges: how can we support our very youngest students if we can’t be with them in person? How can we help the thousands of people who look to the Perkins Library for accessible reading materials? What do we need to do differently for children around the world? Each question had its own answer, but they were universally fueled by our tenacity.</p>
          </div>

              <h1>Tenaciously</h1>

<div class="content-body">
<p data-aos="fade-up">For Ashley, lifelong learning is important. It’s why she had recently taken up learning Spanish. When the pandemic set in earlier this year, she wasn’t sure she would be able to keep getting accessible learning materials to continue her studies. But the Perkins Library was there for her.</p>

<p data-aos="fade-up">A 17-year-patron of the library, Ashley has relied on Perkins throughout the pandemic to deliver her books in English and Spanish audio, as well as in Spanish braille.</p> 

<p data-aos="fade-up">Once she receives the books, she listens to 10 minutes of the story in English. She then reads that same passage over in Spanish braille. And to drive it home, she listens to the passage once more, this time in Spanish audio. She’s not fluent yet, but she is making progress every day.</p> 

<p data-aos="fade-up">“This is something I don’t think I’d be able to pull off without the Perkins Library. It’s been invaluable to my language learning,” she says. “It’s just so helpful that they have such a big language selection.”</p> 

<p data-aos="fade-up">By the end of the summer Ashley had worked her way through the Spanish version of the first Harry Potter book and is now excited to finish the series.</p>

  <div class="forward-bottom">
      <h1 data-aos="fade-right">HOW WE’RE MOVING FORWARD</h1>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">Patrons of the Perkins Library are a diverse group, in age, ability and literary interests. That equals tens of thousands of orders, and fulfilling them takes a lot of work. With your help, we remain up to the task.</p> 

      <p data-aos="fade-right">One of the ways we are keeping up is by training more and more of our patrons to use our braille and audio reading download site that connects borrowers to our vast library, all digitally. And we’re thrilled to now be seeing the number of users grow every month. We’ve also established a suite of remote services, including book clubs, trivia groups, audio-described movie afternoons and so much more. Today, hundreds regularly participate in these activities and our online community is thriving. Even through these challenging and socially distant times, we have kept our community connected.</p>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">We are excited to bring the services our borrowers have always loved back to them, while continuing to champion our digital products and offering these new remote opportunities.</p>
