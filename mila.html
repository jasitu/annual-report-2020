                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ingenuity and innovation drive everything we do. This last year has    been one of the most challenging in recent memory, and we were able to reimagine the ways we   educate children with disabilities and deliver vital services to our community. Your support  made it possible.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Mila loves elevators.</h2> 
        
        <p data-aos="fade-up">The 7-year-old in the Deafblind Program always has fun riding them, while the numbered buttons assigned to each floor have helped teach her to count. That’s why, throughout remote learning, her dad Mike made a habit of taking her for daily elevator rides in a nearby parking garage.</p> 
        
        <p data-aos="fade-up">There was just one problem: When it came time to go home, Mila never wanted to leave. “She was so frustrated with not being able to go to school,” he says. “It was hard to pull her away from one of the few comforts she had.”</p> 
        
        <p data-aos="fade-up">That’s when her teachers at Perkins stepped in with a new strategy. Identifying music as another of Mila’s interests, they recommended bringing a miniature piano along on those trips. When it came time to go home, they said, give her the piano to ease the transition to a new activity.</p>  
        
        <p data-aos="fade-up">“That became our daily routine,” says Mike. “With the piano, she’s not angry or frustrated whatsoever when we leave.”</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-right">At Perkins, every student learns differently. They need individualized instruction from educators who know their unique needs, interests and behaviors. We’re continuing to deliver that one-to-one guidance.</p> 
        
                <p data-aos="fade-right">Our teachers, counselors and educational leaders routinely meet with parents and students through individual conferencing to identify concerns and come up with solutions.</p> 
        
                <p data-aos="fade-right">That’s how they helped Mila learn to leave the elevators. That’s how they’re helping students across the school overcome their own barriers. Your belief in their abilities makes it possible.</p>
